# Long's Sublime Text Packages & Configurations


## Dependencies

### Fonts

+ Source Code Pro
+ IBM Plex Mono

All fonts can be found and downloaded from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Usage

Find the location of `Packages/User/` folder (you can goto `Packages` by simply using the `Preferences/Browse Packages ...` at the menu bar of Sublime Text). If there is no `User` directory, then you can simply create one. Then,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/long-gong/sublime-packages.git .
```


## Customization 

Some packages have been customized such as [LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools), which will be detailed as follows.

### LaTeXTools

A customized builder is added for LaTeXTools, which can help embed all fonts automatically (avoiding post-processing with Adobe or some other tools).
